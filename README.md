4. Drag-and-Drop Interactions:

. Implement drag-and-drop functionality using the ActionChains class (or equivalent for other
WebDriver bindings).
Â· Simulate user behavior (hold, move, release) for precise element manipulation.
. Consider using offsets or dynamic calculations to handle potential Ul changes.

5. File Uploads and Downloads:

. Automate file uploads using send_keys() or interacting with the file input element using
ActionChains .
. Handle file downloads by monitoring browser behavior (e.g., checking download directory for
new files).
. Consider using temporary directories or custom logic to deal with dynamic file names.

6. Data Scraping with Pagination and Dynamic Content:

. Extract data from websites with pagination, using techniques like clicking "Next" buttons or
manipulating URLs.
. Handle dynamic content loading (like infinite scrolling) to ensure complete data capture.
. Apply data validation and filtering techniques to ensure scraped data quality.
